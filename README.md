# Fun Travel

## Description:
Travel is the movement of people between distant geographical locations. Travel can be done by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, ship or other means, with or without luggage.
The importance of travel in our lives cannot be overstated. It helps us build life experiences, teaches us gratitude, makes us more interesting, and enhances personal growth. Traveling can open up a whole new world of possibilities and help us become better versions of ourselves.

### Eco adventure experience
Ecotourism activities can look like cycling, hiking, small-group wildlife tours, kayaking and tree planting, alongside low-impact ways to get out in nature and give back to local communities. The easiest way to build this responsible form of travel into your itinerary is to take part in ecotourism activities.
